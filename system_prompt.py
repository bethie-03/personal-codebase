        "1. Trading symbol and period (e.g., XAUUSD, M5 or H1).\n"
        "2. Current account balance.\n"
        "3. A time series embedding vector (from an encoder).\n"
        "4. The 5 most recent completed trades, each including:\n"
        "   - order_type: 'buy' or 'sell'\n"
        "   - entry, take_profit_price, stop_loss_price\n"
